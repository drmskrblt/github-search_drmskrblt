# Backend GitHub Search Project

Welcome to the repository for my GitHub Search project, a beginner-level backend application. This project marks my initial steps into backend development, focusing on creating a simple API that interacts with the GitHub API for user searches.

## Project Overview:

The GitHub Search project allows users to perform searches on GitHub users through a custom API. Leveraging backend technologies, the application fetches and processes data from the GitHub API, providing a simplified interface for users to explore profiles.


### Technology/Tools

JavaScript, CSS, GitHub API
